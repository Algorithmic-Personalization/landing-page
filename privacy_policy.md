# Privacy Policy

Our extension tweaks YouTube's recommendations by replacing some personalized recommendations with generic ones for logged-out users. It logs non-personal data: video clicks, recommendation types, and timestamps. It operates solely on YouTube.

The research team at MIT CSAIL is committed to the highest standards of data protection. We adhere to both the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) when processing personal data. Your data is neither made public nor shared unauthorizedly with third parties.

Below, we detail the nature of the data collection and its use:

## A. General Information

### Scope of Data Processing
Primarily, we collect and use personal data to facilitate the operation of our web extension on YouTube. User data is typically processed post user consent, except in cases where such processing is sanctioned by law.

### Legal Basis of Data Processing
- If individual consent is obtained for data processing, it adheres to the guidelines of both the CCPA and GDPR.
- For contract-related data processing, both the CCPA and GDPR serve as the legal foundation.
- If data processing serves a genuine interest of MIT CSAIL or a third party, and if this interest does not infringe upon the rights and freedoms of the individual, then both CCPA and GDPR stand as the processing basis.

### Data Deletion and Storage Duration
Personal data of users is either blocked or deleted once its purpose is fulfilled. Storage might continue if mandated by U.S or EU regulations or any legislation that the research team adheres to. Data will be blocked or deleted at the end of a legislated storage period unless further storage is essential for contractual purposes.

## B. Website Access & Log Files
Each website visit results in data and information recording from the accessing computer.

## C. Data Transfer
We generally don't share personal data with third parties unless legally bound. Any third-party service providers in contact with your data adhere to data protection regulations, ensured by legal and technical measures.

## D. Cookies
Visiting certain parts of our websites might place cookies on your computer. These are small files that help improve your browsing experience by recognizing you on subsequent visits. Only the Internet protocol address is stored, ensuring no personal data is captured.

## E. Your Rights
Under both the CCPA and GDPR, you have specific rights pertaining to your data. These include access, rectification, erasure, and data portability among others. Additionally, under GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. For further inquiries, contact our Data Protection Officer.

## F. Policy Updates
Our privacy policies may be updated, always within legal parameters. Users will be informed of any significant changes.
