      <h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>The research team takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. We process personal data gathered when visiting our websites in compliance with applicable data protection legislation. We neither publish your data nor transmit them to third parties on an unauthorized basis.</p>

<p>In the following section, we explain which data we record when you visit one of our websites, and exactly how they are utilized:</p>

<h2 id="a-general-information">A. General Information</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scope of data processing</strong>
As a matter of principle, we gather and utilize users’ personal data only to the extent required to ensure the functioning of our web extension. The gathering and utilization of our users’ personal data normally occurs after users have granted their consent. An exception occurs where data processing is legally permitted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Legal basis of data processing</strong>
To the extent that permission of the affected individual is obtained for the processing of personal data, the consent under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) serves as the legal basis.<br />
In the processing of personal data to fulfill a contract whose contractual party is the individual affected, the CCPA serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing required to implement pre-contractual measures.<br />
If processing is required to safeguard the justified interest of MIT CSAIL or a third party and the interests, basic rights and basic freedoms of the affected individual do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, the CCPA serves as the basis for such processing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data deletion and storage duration</strong>
The affected individual’s personal data are deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of the storage ceases to apply. Storage can also occur if provided for by American legislators in U.S regulations, acts or other legislation to which the research team is subject. A blocking or deletion of data then occurs only if a storage period prescribed by one of the aforementioned norms expires, unless a necessity exists in relation to the further storage of the data for the arrangement of a contract or the fulfilment of a contract.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Contact details of the individuals responsible</strong>
The entity responsible in the meaning of the CCPA and other national data protection acts as well as other data protection legislation is the:
